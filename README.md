Our American brothers and sisters. 
For decades the terrorist regime of Islamic republic has been adopting an aggressive propaganda campaign to convince the Iranian people that Americans are the enemy and to spread hatred between people of the two countries. 
But despite all efforts, the people of Iran, love your country and your people. We appreciate everything you have done so far  in support of our Woman-Life-Freedom revolution. 
You were Iran’s voice, when the voices of Iranian people were being suppressed. When those who shouted these three words were imprisoned, tortured, raped and killed. 

We ask you good American people to be our voice once again. 
As you know, during this world cup event, the Iranians are being pressured and prevented from speaking about the ongoing violation of human rights in their country by the Qatar police with direct orders from the Islamic Republic Regime which could cost people their lives and freedom when they return home. 

If you want to help us, this is how: 

Step 1: 
once you’ve read this letter, pass it on to the person next to you

Step 2:
Grab any piece of paper, make it into a paper plane. 

Step 3: 
On one wing write: 
Love conquers Hate. 
Iran ♥️America 

On the other wing write: 
Woman-Life-Freedom 


Step 4: 
At the exact time of 22’:22” (minute 22 second 22*) throw the paper planes as far as you can, hoping it to reach the playground. 

Thank you and Good luck
*symbolic and in memory of Mahsa Amini, the 22 year old girl who was beaten to death whilst in police custody for not wearing her headscarf correctly; which subsequently kick started the woman-life-freedom revolution.
